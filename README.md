# Counter

## Purpose: To learn react optimixation, useMemo, useCallback, hooks, redux in profound manner.

- Used [React.memo]() for memoizing and preventing reredering of components containing constant props which is for Performance Optimization
- Used [useCallback]() to return a memoized version of a function so to prevent rerendering which is for Performance Optimization

- I am not applying [useCallback]() here because of any 'Performance Obsession' or 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder'. It is simply for [Learning]() purpose.

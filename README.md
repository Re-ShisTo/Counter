# Counter

## Purpose: To learn react optimization, useMemo, useCallback and Custom Hooks in profound manner.

- [Memoization]()is an optimization technique in React for improving performance by caching expensive results or components to avoid unnecessary re-renders and recalculations. It trades memory for speed and is implemented using specific hooks and Higher-Order Components (HOCs).

- Used [React.memo]() for memoizing and preventing rereder of components containing constant props which is for Performance Optimization.

- Used [useCallback]() to return a memoized version of a function so to prevent rerendering which is for Performance Optimization.

- Used [useMemo]() to memoize a return result of a funtion.

- Created a Custom Hook and passed props through the hook. Learned the basics of using a hook.

- I am applying [useCallback]() and [useMemo]() here not because of any 'Performance Obsession' or 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder'. It is simply for [Learning]() purpose.
